<h1>Cheese</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<body>
    <p>Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in wide range of flavors ,textures,and forms by coagulation
        of the milk protein casein.it comprises protein and fat from milk,usually the milk of cows,buffalo,goats,or
        sheep.During production ,the milk is usually acidified,and adding enzymes rennet causes coagulation.The solids
        are separated throughout.Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature. </p>

    <p>Hundreds of types cheese from various countries are produced.Their styles, textures and flavours depend on the
        origin of the milk (including the animal's diet),whether they have been pasteurized,the butterfat content, the
        bacterial and mold,the processing,and aging.Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavouring agents.The
        yellow to red color of many cheese ,such as Red Leicester, is produced by adding annatto.</p>


    <h3>History</h3>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>Cheese is an ancient food whose origin predate record history.There is no conclusive evidence indicating where
        cheese making originated,either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the pracice had spread within
        Europe prior to Roman times and, according to pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time
        the Roman Empire came into being.</p>

    <h3>Ancient Greece and Rome</h3>
    <p>Ancient Greek mythology credited Aristeaus with the discovery of cheese. Homer's <em>odyssey</em> (8th century
        BCE) describes the cyclops making and storing sheep's and goat's milk cheese.</p>

    <h3>Post-Roman Europe </h3>
    <p>As Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly settled neighbours, bringing their own cheese-making
        traditions , their own flocks and thier own unrelated words for cheese, cheeses in Europe diversified further ,
        with
        varios locales developing their own distinctive traditions and products.As long-distance trade collapsed, only
        travelers would encounter unfamiliar cheeses: Charlemagne's first encounter with a white cheese that has an
        edible rind forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's life of the Emperor.</p>

    <h3>Modern era</h3>
    <p> Until its modern spread along with European culture , cheese was nearly unheard of in east Asian cultures, in
        the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited used in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and
        popular only in Europe , the Middle East , the India subcontinent , and areas influenced by those cultures.But
        with the spread , first of European imperialism , and later of Euro-American culture and food , cheese has
        gradually become known and increasingly popular worldwide though still rarely considered a partbof local ethnic
        cuisines outside Europe, the middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the Americas. </p>
